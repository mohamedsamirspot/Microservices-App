<!-- Set up branch protection rules

Go to your repository → Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules.

Add a rule for your default branch (e.g., main or master).

Enable:

Require pull request reviews before merging

Require review from Code Owners

This ensures the PR cannot be merged without the designated reviewer approving the files they own. -->

# A CODEOWNERS file defines who must review changes for specific files or directories.

# Give @mohamedsamirspot code owner access for all files
*  @mohamedsamirspot
